# Overview

## Purpose

This document explains the `SparseCholesky` algorithm for solving linear systems
generated by Graph Laplacians. The algorithm is described in

## Outline

1. [Graphs & Graph Laplacians](graphs/index.html) overviews fundamental concepts about Graphs and Graph Laplacians.
2. [Cholesky Decompositions](cholesky/index.html) derives the scalar and block variants of the Cholesky decomposition.
3. [Sampled Cholesky Decompositions for Graphs](sampledcholesky/index.html) develops sparse, sampled variants of the Cholesky Decompositions for graphs, including `SparseCholesky`.
